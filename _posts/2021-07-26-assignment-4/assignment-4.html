<h2 id="q4-relationships-among-gastech-personnel">Q4: Relationships among GASTech Personnel</h2>
<p><strong>Given the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to question 3, identify the POIs by computing the difference of gps timestamp.</p>
<p>Afterwards, identify who are within ‘close contact’ of each employee based on the difference of their gps coordinates within the same time period.</p>
<p>This can help establish the relationship of GASTech personnel according to their meetings at the same place and at the same time.</p>

<p>The network diagram shows the ‘official’ relationship of employees based on their respective departments. It also show ‘unofficial’ relationship based on the number of their interactions.</p>
<p>From the network diagram, it can be seen that <em>Isande Barrasca</em> , a Drill Technician from the Engineering Department is an outlier. His only close contact to the rest of employees is <em>Hideki Cocinaro</em> , a Site Controller from the Security Department.</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>Sten Sanjorge Jr.</em> , IT Technician from the Information Technology Department, have minimal interactions with other employees and seems not well connected within the company.</p>
<p>The heatmap below visualizes the number of interactions between employees.</p>
